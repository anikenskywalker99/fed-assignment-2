# REFLECTION

## Assignment 2

### Can I explain what my code does?

This part will focus more on the styles.css part of my code.  

In the root of my project, I applied variables that I could use later. In this case, I stuck to choosing colours to be used later. The variable names are not perfect, as I had to change some of the colours later because of contrast issues.  

Next, I applied specific elements to be used in general for the webpage, like the specific font.  

Then I worked on the links. I applied general aspects, like colour, before specifying the links on the navigation bar. There, the links work on moving down to specific parts of the webpage. I also made changes to text decoration depending on where the links were placed. I also applied some changes to links located in #skills to line it up to match the location of the element within the HTML file.  

The following part of the CSS document was created to align the title and image into the centre of the document. This improved the readability of the code.  

I added borders to the sections to separate them and add clarity. This is a way to clearly show when one section ends and another starts. I also enjoy the 3D look, so I added it in for a more Aniken flavour.  

I then worked on more specific sections. I removed styling to the lists, to make the readability better and for more consistent formatting. With having the #skills section as a flexbox, it allowed me to have a list also behave like a sentence, which is what my intention was with that section. Also, I added links to the items in #skills, as a way of clarifying what I meant with each one.  

I only added a photo header because of what the HTML checker recommended, but I kept it hidden so it did not change my webpage. I also centre aligned my svg symbol at the bottom of my webpage.  

The last part of my css file was created to handle different zoom levels and devices using the webpage. The main issue was the text overflowing, so there was some minor changes to handle that. The big issue was that the navigation bar was overflowing, and I struggled with it.  I ended up adding to this part to change the bar from being a row to a column once the screen was zoomed in enough.  

### What is my coding proccess?

I mostly followed the prompts from the assignment instructions. When I thought of something I wanted to add to my webpage, I would go down that path before returning to the instructions. I also attempted to keep the styles.css file in order of how the elements appeared in index.html.  

### What challenges did I have?

I really struggled with time management and handling the navigation bar overflow. I was able to overcome both, but it was irritating and time consuming. The navigation bar issue required a lot of research to understand the issue and what css elements would actually help handle the issue, before returning to the basics of flexbox, which finally solved it.  

### What would I do differently now?

I would have dealt with my time management better. Unlike with the first assignment, I did get a head start on the assignment. However, that was mainly because of the in-class work period. I did get a large portion of the assignment done at that time, but then I left the rest to Friday night, hours before it was due. So the thing I would do differently now, would be to continue working on the project earlier, instead of submitting it last minute.  



## Assignment 1

### Can I explain what my code does?

I struggle with explaining my thoughts, so I will do my best.  The initial part of the code declares the code as HTML 5.  This helps the computer in reading the code.  The head is mainly for metadata, or information about the code's data.  The Title is what is the words in the tab part of the website, as well as the name used when saving a bookmark.  

Next is the body, divided into three parts.  The first is the header, second is the main, and lastly, the footer.  

The header contains in this file, my name written, making a statement of who this resume belongs to.  It also contains an image of me.  

The main body is split into sections.  Each section contains different parts of the resume.  

The first section is my contact information.  I include my phone number, email, GitHub account and LinkedIn account.  For the latter two, I linked them to the actual site containing my accounts.  

The second section is just a little segment about who I am.  

The third section is a list of my skills.  I did not list many, as I focused on a few that are somewhat relevant to web development.  

the fourth section is my work experience.  I combined lists and <h3> to create a list of my work history, emphasizing the titles of my positions, the locations I worked, and what years I worked.  I used an embedded list to include some description of what I did for each job.  

The fifth section is my education.  I followed the same process as the previous section, though this time I emphasized the institute and when I attended the institute.  The embedded lists were used to help describe the specifics of what I did at each institute.  

The sixth section is my references.  For this assignment, I only included their names using <h3>, and then below, I used <p> to describe their occupation.  

The final portion was the footer.  In this case, I simply used an svg graphic as an ending logo.  In this case, I used two hockey sticks crossing each other.  I chose this graphic because I have been playing hockey since I was eight years old, and it is the only sport that I still play.  

### What is my coding proccess?

My coding process does not really contain a lot of planning ahead.  I would read a task, think about what it is asking me, before I head to the document.  I would simply write in order what I was being tasked with, attempting to achieve each task one at a time.  If there were issues with my code, I would start looking at organizing it more specifically, in attempt to fix errors or any irritations I had with the format.  

### What challenges did I have?

I had a lot of issue with attempting to embed an svg into the document.  I ended up mainly copying from the given library, and making some changes to make it fit within my webpage.  I also found out just before writing the reflection that I had actually connected the GitHub to the parent repository of the project, and from I could figure out, there would be no way to fix it without losing my commits, so I have to leave it.  A note for the repository issue, it was that I had an assignment-1 folder with a resume folder inside.  I shoulve have connected to the resume folder, instead I connected to assignment-1.  No data leaks occurred, it is just an extra step for the GitHub repository.  

### What would I do differently now?

The main thing I would do differently now, would be to not procrastinate.  I started on Wednesday, and ended up leaving most of the work to be done on Friday.  Therefore, I was unable to use a helpful one-on-one meeting with the instructor and stressed myself on Friday to get it done on time.  If I had started earlier, I would have avoided a lot of stresses.
