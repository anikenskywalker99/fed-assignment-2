# REFLECTION

## Can I explain what my code does?

I struggle with explaining my thoughts, so I will do my best.  The initial part of the code declares the code as HTML 5.  This helps the computer in reading the code.  The head is mainly for metadata, or information about the code's data.  The Title is what is the words in the tab part of the website, as well as the name used when saving a bookmark.  

Next is the body, divided into three parts.  The first is the header, second is the main, and lastly, the footer.  

The header contains in this file, my name written, making a statement of who this resume belongs to.  It also contains an image of me.  

The main body is split into sections.  Each section contains different parts of the resume.  

The first section is my contact information.  I include my phone number, email, GitHub account and LinkedIn account.  For the latter two, I linked them to the actual site containing my accounts.  

The second section is just a little segment about who I am.  

The third section is a list of my skills.  I did not list many, as I focused on a few that are somewhat relevant to web development.  

the fourth section is my work experience.  I combined lists and <h3> to create a list of my work history, emphasizing the titles of my positions, the locations I worked, and what years I worked.  I used an embedded list to include some description of what I did for each job.  

The fifth section is my education.  I followed the same process as the previous section, though this time I emphasized the institute and when I attended the institute.  The embedded lists were used to help describe the specifics of what I did at each institute.  

The sixth section is my references.  For this assignment, I only included their names using <h3>, and then below, I used <p> to describe their occupation.  

The final portion was the footer.  In this case, I simply used an svg graphic as an ending logo.  In this case, I used two hockey sticks crossing each other.  I chose this graphic because I have been playing hockey since I was eight years old, and it is the only sport that I still play.  

## What is my coding proccess?

My coding process does not really contain a lot of planning ahead.  I would read a task, think about what it is asking me, before I head to the document.  I would simply write in order what I was being tasked with, attempting to achieve each task one at a time.  If there were issues with my code, I would start looking at organizing it more specifically, in attempt to fix errors or any irritations I had with the format.  

## What challenges did I have?

I had a lot of issue with attempting to embed an svg into the document.  I ended up mainly copying from the given library, and making some changes to make it fit within my webpage.  I also found out just before writing the reflection that I had actually connected the GitHub to the parent repository of the project, and from I could figure out, there would be no way to fix it without losing my commits, so I have to leave it.  A note for the repository issue, it was that I had an assignment-1 folder with a resume folder inside.  I shoulve have connected to the resume folder, instead I connected to assignment-1.  No data leaks occurred, it is just an extra step for the GitHub repository.  

## What would I do differently now?

The main thing I would do differently now, would be to not procrastinate.  I started on Wednesday, and ended up leaving most of the work to be done on Friday.  Therefore, I was unable to use a helpful one-on-one meeting with the instructor and stressed myself on Friday to get it done on time.  If I had started earlier, I would have avoided a lot of stresses.
